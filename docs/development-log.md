# Development Log

## 2026-06-16: Phase 0 Memory Baseline

Status: completed.

What was done:

- Read the product development document at `/Users/shaola/Downloads/开发文档/长篇少说开发.md`.
- Summarized the implementation method before coding.
- Created a project-level memory entrypoint in `AGENTS.md`.
- Created `docs/project-memory.md` for MVP scope, product principles, development order, and acceptance baseline.
- Created `docs/product-memory-design.md` for the product's long-form story memory architecture.

Current workspace status:

- No application code has been created yet.
- No framework has been installed yet.
- No database schema has been created yet.

Next recommended step:

- Start Phase 1: scaffold the local Next.js MVP with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, SQLite, base layout, and project CRUD.

Rules for future phases:

- Read `AGENTS.md` and the docs in this folder before starting.
- Keep each phase scoped.
- Update this log after completing a phase.
- Preserve the MVP exclusions until the user explicitly expands scope.

## 2026-06-16: Repository Setup

Status: completed.

Goal:

- Create a local Git repository.
- Create a matching private GitHub repository.
- Push the current memory baseline before Phase 1 implementation begins.

Repository name:

- `novelforge-ai`

GitHub repository:

- `https://github.com/xdgf558/novelforge-ai`

What was done:

- Initialized local Git repository on `main`.
- Added `.gitignore` and `README.md`.
- Created the private GitHub repository.
- Added `origin`.
- Pushed the initial repository state to GitHub.

## 2026-06-17: Phase 1 Project Skeleton and Project CRUD

Status: completed.

Scope:

- Next.js local MVP skeleton.
- TypeScript configuration.
- Tailwind CSS configuration and base styling.
- Prisma and SQLite setup.
- Base application layout.
- Project CRUD only.

What was done:

- Added App Router pages for project list, project creation, project detail, and project editing.
- Added server actions for project create, update, and delete.
- Added Prisma `Project` model and initial migration.
- Added local `.env.example` with `DATABASE_URL`.
- Added reusable project form and app shell components.
- Added README local development commands.
- Added PostCSS override to avoid the moderate npm audit issue reported through Next's nested PostCSS dependency.

Verification:

- `npm install` completed and reported 0 vulnerabilities after the PostCSS override.
- `npx prisma migrate dev` reports the database is in sync.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- Browser verification passed for homepage, create project, project detail, edit project, delete project, and empty state.
- Browser console had no error or warning entries during the CRUD check.
- Local SQLite project count returned to 0 after deleting the browser test project.

Notes:

- The first `prisma migrate dev --name init` failed because Prisma could not create the first SQLite file on this volume path. Creating an empty `prisma/dev.db`, running `prisma db push`, generating the initial migration SQL with `prisma migrate diff`, and marking that migration as applied resolved the issue.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` briefly returned a registry 503 during the final recheck, but the preceding `npm install` audit completed with 0 vulnerabilities.

Next recommended step:

- Start Phase 2: project setting editor and setting version records.

## 2026-06-17: Phase 1 Review Fixes

Status: completed.

What was done:

- Hardened `formatWordRange` by using nullish checks instead of truthiness checks.
- Changed homepage active project and target word statistics to use Prisma `count` and `aggregate`.
- Added `cp .env.example .env` to README local setup steps.

Deferred review items:

- Test framework setup is deferred to Phase 2, where setting-version behavior will benefit more from regression tests.
- Friendly Server Action error handling is deferred until form state handling is introduced.
- Dependency ranges remain paired with `package-lock.json`; use `npm ci` for reproducible installs.
